# IndexedDB Promise

> **Important:** This is an ESM only package. It uses the browserâ€™s IndexedDB API.

You can find tests and example code on the GitHub repository that will help you understand how to use this package. [github.com/StephenHassall/indexeddb-promise](https://github.com/StephenHassall/indexeddb-promise)

> **Important:** Most of the functions return a `Promise` object and need to be used with the `await` keyword. Not doing this will create errors. If you do have problems using the package then the first thing you need to do is double check any missing `await` statements.

## Installation

```
npm install @coderundebug/indexeddb-promise

## Introduction

The IndexedDB API is a database in the browser, however it is not the same as a large SQL like database, but more like a simple object store with indexes. It is different compared to other databases you may have used before, but once you understand how to use it, you will find it very useful for storing data on the client end.

All the API tasks are performed on a different thread and any request to do something is performed on that thread. Once the task is performed it sends an event to signal that it has finished (or failed). When doing a number of tasks together, adding and removing records, dealing with the events can become a pain. This package was created to add promises to the tasks, allowing you to use async/await to perform the steps one after the other.

```javascript
// Create instance of my database
const myDatabase = new MyDatabase();

// Open the database
await myDatabase.open();

// Create transaction
const transaction = myDatabase.transaction('my-object-store', 'readwrite');

// Open my object store (table)
const myObjectStore = transaction.objectStore('my-object-store');

// Add record (object/document)
await myObjectStore.add({ id: 1, text: 'hello' });
await myObjectStore.add({ id: 2, text: 'world' });

// Commit changes
await transaction.commit();

// Close my database
myDatabase.close();
```
All the classes are wrappers to the IDB interfaces but with promises and one or two extra helpful functions. The goal of this package is to make using the IndexedDB API easier, more understandable, but without replacing the core functions with something totally new.

You will find information on how most of the functions work by looking at the related interface functions associated with them. Their functions and parameters are basically the same.

## Database

This class is a wrapper to the `IDBDatabase` interface, but you cannot use it directly, it needs to be derived from. You create your own class that extends from the `Database` class and then override the `_upgrade` function. This is used to create the internal object stores and indexes.

```javascript
class MyDatabase extends Database {
  constructor() {
    // Call base constructor to set database name and version
    super('my-database', 1);
  }

  _upgrade(transaction, oldVersion, newVersion) {
    // New version (or first time)
    this.createObjectStore('objectStore1');
    this.createObjectStore('objectStore2');
  }
}
```

|Name|Information|
|---|---|
|**constructor**(*name*, *version*)|When you have derived your own class from `Database`, make sure you call the `super` function with the name of the database and its current version.|
|**iDbDatabase**|Get the `IDBDatabase` interface object associated with the database.|
|**version**|Get the version of the database.|
|**name**|Get the name of the database.|
|**objectStoreNames**|Get a list of object store names contained within the database.|

You need to override this function within your own class and perform any upgrading steps required. You can use `async` with this function if required.|
|**_close**|Override this function to handle when the database is closed unexpectedly. This is not called when the `close` function is used. |
